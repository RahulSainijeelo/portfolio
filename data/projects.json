To make a secure, scalable and robust system that can handle thousands of concurrent users. Sending transactional and authentication emails reliably was also concerning and new to me.",
            "solutions": "Utilized WebSockets for real-time communication, ensuring instantaneous updates across all user interfaces. Employed RabbitMQ as a message broker with a orderOutbox table to manage order processing efficiently. For email services, integrated with third-party providers like Zoho's Zeptomail to ensure reliable delivery of transactional emails. Adopted JWT for secure authentication and Prisma ORM with Postgres for efficient database management.",
            "features": "Implemented order worker to handle the missed orders by the Message Broker for error free handling. Implemented Cleam Ui's for Users (seller_front) that is the main page for order placement and user ui, Restaurant Partner application with going offline and online functionlities to recieve/not recieve orders (In Real Time). Also Implemted Delivery Parner ui with same functionlities to process the to pickup and deliver the ready orders from the restauntants to the user locations. also implemented Admin Dashboard to monitor the whole system with order tracking and management. the dashboard has functionlities to add sub admins and registring the restaurants and drivers securely and driver assignment to the restaurants. It's also the managing place to manage payments and settelments and reports etc.",
            "outcome": "After 2.5 months of development, around 600 git commits and crafting & managing service classes and endpoints for a database of 32 SQL tables, I finally reach to near end of this platform development. After a real hassel I have been able to develop a robus and complete working platfrom (Not some simulation). Implement my best knowledge of backend and frontend development to make this system work in real-time with all the functionlities required for a food delivery system. The system is now capable of handling thousands of concurrent users with real-time updates, secure transactions, and reliable email communications. This project has significantly enhanced my skills in full-stack development, real-time data handling, and system architecture design. "
